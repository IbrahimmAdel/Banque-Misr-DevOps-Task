## Project Structure
The project is meticulously organized to encompass various phases, each tailored to address specific elements within the infrastructure:

- **Dockerization**: Crafted Dockerfiles for the Flask app , coupled with a Docker Compose file for streamlined local testing.
- **Azure DevOps Pipeline**: Orchestrated a robust CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps for continuous integration and deployment of the Flask app on an AKS cluster, while leveraging Azure PostgreSQL for the database.
- **Terraform**: Defined infrastructure components pertinent to Azure, encompassing the creation of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and other essential resources.
- **Kubernetes**: Developed Kubernetes manifests tailored for Azure, dictating the deployment specifications for the Flask app and integration with Azure PostgreSQL on the AKS cluster.
